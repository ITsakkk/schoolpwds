Student ID: This is a unique identifier for each student. It serves as the primary key for the table and is used to link the student status records to the corresponding student in the main student information table.
Academic Year/Semester: This field stores the academic year and semester in which the student's status is recorded. It helps in tracking the progress of students over time and is often represented as a combination of year and semester (e.g., "2024 Fall").
Enrollment Status: This field indicates whether the student is currently enrolled, on leave, graduated, expelled, or any other relevant enrollment status. It helps administrators and advisors keep track of the student's current academic standing.
GPA (Grade Point Average): This field stores the student's cumulative GPA up to the current academic year/semester. It provides an overview of the student's academic performance over time.
Credits Completed: This field tracks the total number of credits completed by the student. It helps in monitoring progress towards degree completion and determining eligibility for graduation.
Degree Program: This field specifies the degree program in which the student is enrolled (e.g., Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, Master of Business Administration). It helps in categorizing students based on their academic pursuits.
Advisor/Supervisor: This field stores the name or ID of the faculty member who serves as the student's academic advisor or supervisor. It facilitates communication between students and their advisors and enables advisors to monitor their advisees' progress.
Date of Status Update: This field records the date when the student's status was last updated in the system. It helps in auditing changes to student records and ensuring data accuracy.
By maintaining a comprehensive student status table with these fields (and potentially additional fields based on specific university requirements), the university can effectively manage student records, track academic progress, and provide necessary support and guidance to students throughout their academic journey.
